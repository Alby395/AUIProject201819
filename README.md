# AUIProject201819

Project developed for the Advanced User Interface course at Politecnico di Milano.

The objective of this project was to develop a VR experience to help the user with social anxiety.

The applications puts the user inside a theatre where he can try his own speech in front of a virtual audience. The amount of people visible changes in time based on the data received from the Empatica device and they are also able to react and ask question (that are loaded) to the user.
