In the future this project could be extended in many different ways:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Empatica E4 biosensor could be changed with a more specialized one that could track parameters in a more precise way while introducing new one. One option could be the usage of smart clothing that offer the possibility to track both HR and GSR while also allowing the tracking of the breathing activity. The last one can be used as a anxiety level tracker (like the other two parameters) but also as a mean to introduce breathing exercise to calm down the subject if needed;
	\item The whole project could be changed to use a different kind of VR device. The usage of devices as HTC Vive or Oculus Rift can improve the performance of the application while also increasing the number of people used in the audience so to make it a little more challenging for the user. The fact that Unity was used to develop this project could make the transition to a different device a little bit more easy to do as most of the scripts are not specific on the Android platform and the build settings can be easily changed.
