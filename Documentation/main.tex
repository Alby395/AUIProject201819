	\begin{abstract}
	This project offers people that have fear of speaking in public an instrument that allows them to try their speech in a virtual environment. This basic idea is expanded by using a biosensor to manipulate the environment the user is put in: the amount of people that the user sees in the audience changes based on the anxiety level determined by reading the values from the biosensor.
